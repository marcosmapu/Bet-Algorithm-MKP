# Bet-Algorithm-MKP
Bet algorithm is a search-algorithm metaheuristic inspired by Bet Theory to solve combinatorial optimization problems.

This particular code was developed and implemented by me in 2018 to solve the MKP (Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem).

# MKP
The Multi-dimensional Knapsack problem is a generalisation of the traditional knapsack problem where your aim is to fill it in the best possible way. Each item has a value and occupy a space in the n different dimensions of the knapsack. The number of items is limited to these dimensions constraints and the ultimate goal is to get the most value out of the knapsack.
